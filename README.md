# WinGameAlpha Texture Editor

## Settings
There must be a file named settings.wgas which contains information in the following format
```
colour: 0xff0000, 0x00ff00, 0x0000ff
size: 5
```
the colour tag is followed by up to 9 hex codes which will be binded to the keyboard keys 1-9 with 0 being the alpha toggle i.e. the eraser.
the size tag is the width and height of each 'pixel' in relation to a percentage of the window height.
